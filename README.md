Fast `scoop search` drop-in replacement üöÄ
Forked from [scoop-search](https://github.com/shilangyu/scoop-search) by [shilangyu](https://github.com/shilangyu)

## Installation

```sh
scoop install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/voidei/shovel-search/master/shovel-search.json
```

## Hook

Instead of using `shovel-search.exe <term>` you can setup a hook that will run `shovel-search.exe` whenever you use native `shovel search`

Add this to your Powershell profile (usually located at `$PROFILE`)

```ps1
Invoke-Expression (&shovel-search --hook)
```

## Features

Returns identical results as `scoop search`, though it doesn't behave the same as `scoop search`, so if that's what you want, please check upstream.

## Deviations from scoop search

### Building

To enable online lookup, you'll need to link an API key:

```sh
# How you find this API key is up to you
go build -ldflags="-X 'main.shovelSearchApiKey=something'"
```
